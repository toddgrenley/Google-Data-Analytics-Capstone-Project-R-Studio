# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-R-Studio

This is a project I completed for my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It is the capstone project that was assigned at the end, designed to pull together
everything that was learned over the eight courses. More details are in the markdown file, but in short it is a case study designed to put you in the shoes of a junior data
analyst answering business questions for a bike share company based in Chicago. We had the choice to use whatever tool we deemed appropriate, so I chose RStudio as it could
handle the large amount of data, as well as do cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. It is a markdown file that allows the user to follow step-by-step.
